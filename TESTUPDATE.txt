The Raspberry Pi has trouble with closing the connection
to USB devices, because of it's kernel drivers. This means
we can't connect to the printer twice or it will error
with LIBUSB_ERROR_BUSY. To mittigate this we create the
connection to the printer in a seperate process which will
automaticly stop after the printing is done and free the
connection. The code below executes the print.js file with
node and the recognised sentence as the first argument.
Further down, the same code is run without an argument,
which will print the welcome message.
